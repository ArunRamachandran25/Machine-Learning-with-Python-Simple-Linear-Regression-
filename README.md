# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Simple-Linear-Regression-
In this lab, we learn how to use scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
